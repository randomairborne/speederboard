# Developing the speederboard frontend

I (valkyrie_pilot) suck at frontend. Therefore, I have endeavored to make developing the frontend as easy as possible.
There is a very simple JavaScript app in `./dev-cdn`, which provides the fakeS3 and CDN endpoints.

You can run it with `npm i && node ./index.js`.
It does not verify fakeS3 tokens, so you can just set that to `a` or something.
It's very slow, don't use it in production!

Thanks for your contribution.
