# writing translations
Hello translator! Developing translations for speederboard is pretty easy. 
The file format is extremely basic, using a simple JSON dictionary of translation
keys which map to translation values. You can view the english file, which also
serves as a source of truth for the keys, [here](https://github.com/speederboard/speederboard/blob/main/translations/en.lang).
