A game leaderboard website.

If you're looking to contribute, you might want to have a look at TEMPLATES.md or in a file in ./public

suggested dev command:

```bash
cargo watch -x r -w ./templates -w ./src
```

this command will near-instantly update templates and public, and update src within about 2 seconds, depending on how big your changes are.
