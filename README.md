suggested dev command:

```bash
cargo watch -x r -w ./src
```

This command will near-instantly update templates and public, and update src within about 2 seconds, depending on how big your changes are.

## windows

On windows, you can also download the exe: [speederboard.exe](https://user-content.speederboard.org/executables/speederboard.exe).
it requires certain environment variables, but most of them have sane localhost-y defaults or will be pointed out to you on run.
You will need to clone the repository and run speederboard.exe in the speederboard root directory, but you need to do this for
development anyway
